Powerful Colonial Legislatures:" + "\n" + "• American assemblies have claimed the right to levy taxes, make appropriations, approve appointments, and pass laws for their colonies. Assemblies had leverage over the governor through their control of the colonial budget and they could circumvent the Privy Council. A conference of colonial leaders with delegates from Penn, Maryland, New York, and New England was meeting in Albany in that year to negotiate a treaty with the Iroquois." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Colonies Divided:" + "\n" + "• Ben Franklin proposed the Albany Plan by which Parliament would set up in America “one general government” for all the colonies (except Georgia and Nova Scotia); central government would have a “president general” appt. and paid by the king. Crisis began in part because of expansion of French presence in America in late 17th century. Fort Louisburg, guarded approach of St. Lawrence, Montreal, New Orleans, Biloxi, and Mobile to the east. Shared territories with large and powerful Indian population in regions labeled 'middle grounds'. France offered Indians tolerance; settlers adjusted their own behavior to Indian patterns; better relations with Indians than the English." + "\n" + "• The Iroquois Confederacy consisted of Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, and Oneida formed commercial relationship with English and Dutch although they continued to trade with the French. The principal area of conflict was Ohio Valley which the French claimed and several competing Indian tribes lived there and English settlement was expanding into it and the Iroquois were trying to settle there; potential battleground. Queen Anne ascended the throne after William and carried Anglo-French wars that cont. for 80 years. King William’s War was a clash between the English and French in north New England and Queen Anne’s War continued for 12 years with Spaniards and Indians. Treaty of Utrecht brought conflict to a close in 1712 giving French territory to English. The aftermath of King George’s War was that relations among English, French, and Iroquois deteriorated. At Fort Necessity, George Washington was sent to Ohio Valley to challenge French expansion; third of them died and Washington surrendered; clash marked start of war." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. The Great War for the Empire:" + "\n" +
            "• General Edward Braddock failed to retake the crucial site at the forks of the Ohio Valley where Washington had lost the battle; French and Indian killed Braddock. Governments of France and England formally opened hostilities and a truly international conflict began; war was marked by a complex system of alliances" + "\n" + "• France allied with Austria; England allied with Prussia. William Pitt planned strategy and enlisted colonists “impressment” in militia. French outnumbered by British colonists and were seizing French stronghold; Amherst and Wolfe seized Louisburg but Duscquene fell without a fight." + "\n" +
                "• Siege of Quebec: Amherst seized French territorial Quebec and a year later, French army surrendered to Amherst in Montreal. British achieved most of Pitt’s aims in the Peace of Paris signed in 1763." + "\n" + "• Peace of Paris: G.B. got Canada and east of Mississippi, except New Orleans; French ceded New Orleans and west of Missi. To Spain. The Iroquois confederacy that allied with British only fared a little better than those who allied with the French; contested English for Ohio Valley." + "\n" +
                "New Imperialism:" + "\n" + "• English was at peace but in debt from war. Unwilling to be taxed by Parliament to support war effort, colonists were reluctant to tax themselves as well. Mercantilists wanted England to return Canada to France in exchange for Guadeloupe, the most commercially valuable of the French “sugar islands” in West Indies; territorialists prevailed however." + "\n" + "• Landlords and merchants were objecting to increases in what they already considered high taxes, necessity of numbers of British troops on the Indian border was adding even more to the cost of defending American settlement, could not rely on cooperation from colonial gov’ts., only taxation system administered from London would help, George III became king and removed Whigs because of mistrust" + "\n" + "George had many shortcomings and contributed to instability Grenville: prime minister in 1763 and said the colonists must obey the laws and pay a cost of defending the empire" + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. British and the Tribes:" + "\n" + "• When English settlers moved into Ohio Valley, tribes under Pontiac struck back. In response: Proclamation of 1763 forbade settlers to advance beyond a line drawn along the App.Mountains" + "\n" +
                "• Benefits: British could control white settlement, slow exodus from coastal colonies, where England’s most important markets and investments were, and would reserve opportunities for fur trading and land speculation" + "\n" + "\n" + "V. The Colonial Response:" + "\n" + "• Sugar Act of 1764: designed in part to eliminate the illegal sugar trade between the continental colonies and the French and Spanish West Indies" + "\n" + "• Currency Act of 1764: required colonial assemblies to stop issuing paper money" + "\n" + "• Stamp Act of 1765: imposed a tax on most printed docs in the newspapers, pamphlets, etc." +
                "\n" + "• Effect: British officials were soon collecting more than 10x as much annual revenue from America before 1763; created problems" + "\n"
                + "• Bad Results: Paxton Boys demanded relief from colonial taxes and for money to help them defend themselves against the Indians; only made concessions to them. Small civil war broke out from Regulator Movement in North Carolina; farmers who organized opposition to high taxes that local sheriffs collected. To suppress, William Tyron (governor) raised an army of militiamen defeated them" +
                "\n" + "\n" + "VI. Stirrings of Revolt:" + "\n" + "• Effects of Stamp Act: direct attempt by England to raise revenue in the colonies without consent of colonial assemblies. House of B. sounded the “trumpet of sedition” when committed treason and said that if he does not revoke the policies, George III will lose his head. (Led by Patrick Henry)" + "\n" + "• Created the Virginia Resolves when H. of B defeated not all of Henry’s resolutions." + "\n" + "• Sons of Liberty: 1st terrorist group" + "\n" + "• Rockingham who succeeded PM Grenville killed the Stamp Act. In response, Parliament passed the Declatory Act asserting its authority over the colonies in all cases whatsoever" + "\n" + "• Townshend Program: named after Charles Townshend; purpose was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to G.B., to create a more effective way of enforcing compliance with trade regulations, to punish NY for failing to comply w. Quartering Act, and to est. that Parliament had the right to tax the colonies" + "\n" + "• Resulted in: Boston Massacre: British army soldiers killed 5 male civilians and injured six others; Crispus Atticks was killed" + "\n" + "Samuel Adams became part of opposition to the British rule and proposed creation of committee of correspondence to publicize the grievances against England. England’s balanced constitution: checked balances between the monarchy, aristocracy, and common people (king was becoming too powerful and was becoming corrupt)" + "\n" + "• No taxation without representation: people weren’t represented in parliament" + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. Tea Excitement:" + "\n" + "• Occasional acts of rebellion: residents of Rhode Island boarded the Gaspee and set it afire and sank it in Narragansett Bay; sent defendants to England for trial instead of colonial courts" + "\n" + "• Tea Act: permitted the company to sell tea directly to colonists without colonist middlemen (cheaper tea) and American colonists were upset" + "\n" + "• Was supposed to convince colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, this implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament’s right of taxation. Resistance leaders argued that it was another example of results of unconstitutional tax; responded by boycotting tea (Boston Tea Party)" + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. Coercive or Intolerable Acts:" + "\n" + "• Port Bill: shut down Port of Mass. Until they pay reparations for tea. Gov’t Act: no more local governments. New Quartering Act: took away pay for housing soldiers. Admin. Of Justice Act: all courts were controlled by British. Quebec Act: controlled by the British; was to provide gov’t for French speaking in Canada and granted rights to Roman Catholics" + "\n" + "• Cooperation and War: Samuel Adams made comm. Of corresp. And then Virginia called 1st Continental Congress: 55 delegates from 12 colonies and Rhode Island did not show up. Respond to acts: 1 vote per colony represented at Penn. State House" + "\n" + "\n" + "VIII. 5 major decisions:" + "\n" + "1) Rejected Galloway’s plan for a colonial union under British authority. 2) Endorsed statement of grievances with language reflecting extremists and moderates. 3) Approved that colonists make military preparations for defense against possible attack by British troops in Boston. 4) Agreed to means for stopping all trade with G.B. continental association. 5) Agreed to meet again to continue congress" + "\n" + "• Conciliatory Propositions: parliament proposed that colonies would tax themselves at their demand" + "\n" + "• Lexington and Concord: Thomas Gage sent 1000 soldiers out from Boston and intend to surprise colonials. British had lost almost three times as many men as the Americans"

Defining American War Aims:" + "\n" + "• Three weeks after battle at L. & C.: 2nd continental congress convened: 1) Separated into two groups: group led by Adam cousins who favored complete autonomy from G.B. and moderates led by Dickinson who hoped for modest reforms in the relationship that would permit an early reconciliation w. G.B. 2) Approved 'Olive Branch petition' which British gov’t rejected & on July 6, 1775, they adopted 'Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms.'" +
                "\n" + "• Proclaimed that the British gov’t had left the American people with only 2 alternatives, unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers or resistance by force." + "\n" + "• Prohibitory Act: closed the colonies to all overseas trade and made no concessions to American demands except an offer to pardon repentant rebels" + "\n" + "• Common Sense by Thomas Paine: it was common sense to break completely from parliament and the king that had George III as a monarch, dragged Americans into war in which they had no interest, and inflict such brutality on its people." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Decision for Independence:" + "\n" + "• July 2, 1776 continental congress adopted a resolution when they appointed a committee to draft a formal declaration of independence; two days later, Congress approved the Declaration of Independence" + "\n" + "Two parts: 1) restated Locke and said “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” 2) Listed the alleged crimes of the king that had violated his contract" + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Responses to Independence:" + "\n" + "• Those who supported independence knew loyalists as Tories. Americans began to do something they would continue for two centuries: balance the commitment to state and local autonomy against the need for centralized authority" + "\n" + "• Articles of Confederation: 1777 (ratified till 1781): did not make it clear that the Congress was to be a real gov’t" + "\n" + "\n" + "IV.

British departed Boston (started beginning of the war)" + "\n" + "Second Phase of the War:" + "\n" + "• Britain sent army of 32,000 to New York under command of William Howe; he hoped to send them into submission from awe (offered Congress royal pardon but America continued the war even with army of poor 19,000)" + "\n" +

Night occupied Trenton and then went to Princeton and drove British force from their base there (unable to hold Princeton or Trenton); British devised plan to divide U.S.: Howe would have north from NYC up to Albany, while another force would come south from Canada to meet him (Burgoyne took control of north)" + "\n" + "• Howe abandoned plan and launched assault on Philadelphia (hoped to discourage Patriots); removed forces from NY and went to Chesapeake Bay and proceeded north to Philadelphia (able to occupy); At this time, Washington went into winter quarters at Valley Forge and Continental Congress reassembled at York, Pennsylvania." + "\n" +

He seized Fort Ticonderoga and caused dismay b/c Congress removed Schuyler from command of American forces in the north and replaced him with Gates." + "\n" + "• Burgoyne had two defeats: one of them Oriskany: patriot band led by Herskimer held off a force of Tories commanded by St. Leger and gave Arnold time to go to St. Leger’s advance; 2nd was at Bennington when Stark mauled detachment that he sent out to seek supplies. Burgoyne surrendered in Saratoga and became a major turning point in the war b/c it led to U.S. alliance with France" + "\n" + "\n" +

Iroquois and the British:" + "\n" + "• Confederacy declared neutral and Joseph and Mary Brant persuaded their tribe to contribute to the British cause and attracted support from Seneca and Cayuga. Only 3 of 6 nations of confederacy supported the British; Oneida and Tuscararo backed Americans" + "\n" + "• After Oriskany, Iroquois allied with British in New York but Patriot forces under John Sullivan retaliated and large groups fled into Canada and never returned." + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. Securing Aid from Abroad:" + "\n" + "• America needed new trade partners so Congress sent 'militia diplomats' to negotiate commercial treaties and require European gov’ts to recognize U.S. as independent nation" + "\n" + "• Louis XVI: France began supplying Americans with large quantities but did not give it diplomatic recognition so Franklin went to France and gained popularity and news of American victory at Saratoga so France recognized it as independent." + "\n" + "Final Phase: The South:" + "\n" + "• Britain tried to gain Loyalist support but underestimated Patriot population.

War and Society:" + "\n" + "Loyalists and Minorities:" + "\n" + "• Some Loyalists were office holders in imperial government (lose positions) or merchants engaged in trade closely tied to imperial system; Cultural and ethnic minorities who feared that independence would not offer them protection; These people were hounded by patriots or harassed by legis. and judic. Actions (up to 100,000 fled) ex. Thomas Hutchinson (Tory governor)" + "\n" + "• Many Anglican parishes no longer had clergymen and weakened the Quakers in Penn. b/c of widespread of pacifism; Strengthened Roman Catholic Church b/c of French alliance that brought Catholic troops and chaplains (Father John Carroll = head)" + "\n" + "\n" + "IX. War and Slavery:" + "\n" + "• British encouraged them to leave the country to disrupt war effort. African Americans engaged in open resistance to white control and in SC, Jeremiah (free black) was executed after Patriot leaders accused him of conspiring to smuggle British guns; Slave-owners opposed British efforts to emancipate their slaves, but feared rebellions. Americans feared that without slaves, it would be impossible to have a workforce but that inequalities would jeopardize survival of liberty." + "\n" + "Native Americans:" + "\n" + "• For Patriots: wanted to expand into western lands at expense of Indians (complained about Proclamation Line); Both sides tried to recruit Indians to help them; Dragging Canoe attacked white settlements and Patriots forced them to Tennessee River; Jefferson came to view them as “noble savages” uncivilized in their present state but redeemable if they were willing to adapt to white society" + "\n" + "• Lord Dunmore’s War: Shawnee Indians in west. Virginia tried to lead an uprising against white settlers moving into lands in Kentucky and attracted no allies and were defeated; Most vicious massacre: white militias killed a peaceful band of Delaware Indians in Ohio" + "\n" + "\n" + "XI. Women’s Rights and Women’s Roles:" + "\n" + "• Women either stayed home when husbands went to war or went to the camps of Patriot armies to join their male relatives; Washington and other Patriots called them distracting but they helped with army morale, cooking, laundry, and nursing" + "\n" + "• Some women became involved in combat: Molly Pitcher (carried pitchers to soldiers) took husband’s place at a filed gun and some women disguised themselves as men to fight; Abigail Adams sent John Adams a letter for equal rights for women after war; Judith Murray wrote in 1779 that women deserved access to education and Franklin and Rush voiced opinions for education" + "\n" + "\n" + "XII. War Economy:" + "\n" + "• Yankees began to prey on British commerce with privateers and proved to be more profitable than ordinary peacetime trade; Americans opened trade with Asia; Americans began to make their own cloth “homespun” to replace British fabrics" + "\n" + "\n" + "XIII. Creation of State Governments:" + "\n" + "• Republicanism and equality of opportunity; American society was more open than European but native Americans and slaves were not given same opportunities as whites" + "\n" + "• First State Constitutions: written constitution and George and Penn.

Causes of the Reformation:" + "\n" + "14th and 15th century:" + "\n" + "• John Wycliffe: was an English reformer who argued that the Church was becoming too remote from the people and advocated for simplification of its doctrines and less power for the priests." + "\n" + "-He believed that only the Scriptures declared the will of God and questioned transubstantiation, the ability of the priests to perform a miracle turning the wine and bread into Christ’s blood and body. " + "\n" + "-His views were branded heretical, but he was able to survive in hiding though his remains were dug up by the Church in 1428 and burned." + "\n" + "-He left an underground movement called the Lollards who faced constant persecution."
                + "\n" + "• Jan Hus claimed that the Church was made up of all of the faithful. He questioned transubstantiation, and said that the priest and the people should all have both the wine and the bread. " + "\n" + "-He was burned at the stake in 1415, but his followers, led by Zizka, raised an army and won against the emperor, who let them to set up their own church in which both the wine and bread were eaten by all. " + "\n" + "• The Great Schism: event that greatly undermined both the power and prestige of the Church " + "\n" + "• The Printing Press: many people didn’t have access to information or changes in religious thought except through word of mouth and the village" + "\n" + "-With the printing press, new ideas, and the dissatisfaction with the church spread quickly and people could read the Bible for themselves; led to popular dissent of the church " + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Other Causes:" + "\n" + "• The growth in the power of the secular king and the decrease in the power of the Pope." + "\n" + "• The popular discontent with the seemingly empty rituals of the Church." + "\n"
                + "• The movement towards more personal ways of communicating with God, called lay piety." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Church taking advantage of their power: " + "\n" + "• Simony: the sale of Church positions, which quickly led to people becoming Church officials purely for economic motives, and not for spiritual ones." + "\n" + "• Indulgences: the sale of indulgences was the biggest moneymaker for the Church. When a person paid for an indulgence, it supposedly excused the sins they had committed (the more $, the more sins forgiven) even without them having to repent. Indulgences could even be bought for future sins not yet committed and for others, especially those who had just died, and were supposed to make a person’s passage into heaven faster. " + "\n" + "• Dispensations: payments that released a petitioner from the requirements of the canon law.  " + "\n" + "• Incelebacy: church officials getting married and having children." + "\n" + "• Pluralism: having more than one position at a time." + "\n" + "• Nepotism: control by a particular family. " + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. What is the Reformation?" + "\n" + "• The Reformation was the final splitting of the Western Church into two halves." + "\n" + "• The two branches of the Church were Catholicism and Protestantism. " + "\n" + "\n" + "V. What Martin Luther did and why:" + "\n" + "• Luther: was born into a middle class family in Saxony, Germany. He got a good education and began studying law. After almost being hit by lightning, he decided to become a monk." + "\n" + "• Obsessed with his own sinfulness, and pursued every possible opportunity to earn worthiness in God’s eyes but he was still not satisfied, for he felt that God would never forgive a sinner like himself." + "\n" + "• Finally, he had an intense religious experience that led him to realize that justification in the eyes of God was based on faith alone and not on good works and sacraments." + "\n" + "• Then, in 1517, he saw a friar named Johann Tetzel peddling indulgences and claiming that by buying them, people could save themselves time in the purgatory. "
                + "\n" + "• The theses explained that the Pope could remit only the penalties he or canon law imposed, and that for other sins, the faithful had only to sincerely repent to obtain an indulgence, not pay the Church." + "\n" + "• An Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation made a patriotic appeal to Germans to reject the foreign Pope’s authority." + "\n" + "• The Babylonian Captivity attacked the belief that the seven sacraments were the only means of attaining grace, saying that only two, baptism and the Eucharist (which were mentioned in the Bible) were important." + "\n" + "• The Liberty of the Christian Man → explained his principle of salvation by faith alone." + "\n" + "\n" + "Diet of Worms:" + "\n" + "• Luther’s writings could no longer be ignored, and, in 1520, Pope Leo the Fifth excommunicated him, and Luther responded by calling the Pope an anti-Christ. " + "\n" + "• At Worms, Luther refused to retract his statements, asking to be proved wrong with the Bible. So, Charles ordered that Luther be arrested and his works burned" + "\n" + "\n" + "V. Ideals of Lutheranism: " + "\n" + "• Codified in the Augsburg Confession the Lutheran beliefs are as follows:" + "\n" + "1. Justification by faith alone, or the belief that faith alone, without the sacraments or good works, leads to an individual’s salvation." + "\n" + "2. The Bible as the only authority, not any subsequent works. " + "\n" + "3. All people are equally capable of understanding God’s word as expressed in the Bible and can gain salvation without the help of an intermediary. " + "\n" + "4. No distinction between priests and laity. " + "\n" + "5. Consubstantiation (the presence of the substance and Christ coexist in the wafer and wine and no miracle occurs) instead of transubstantiation." + "\n" + "6. A simplified ceremony with services not in Latin. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. Why Did People Support Protestantism?" + "\n" + "• Appeal to the peasants:" + "\n" + "1. Message of equality in religion, which they extended to life in general." + "\n" + "2. A simplified religion with fewer rituals, which made it easier to understand." + "\n" + "3. Luther rebelled, which inspired many of them to do the same." + "\n" + "Appeal to the nobles:" + "\n" + "1. No tithe to pay, so $ stays in the country." + "\n"
                + "2. Since they are against Charles for political reasons, they can justify it by becoming Protestant." + "\n" + "3. No more church owned land, so they can get more land." + "\n" + "4. No tithe for peasants, so they can tax them more." + "\n" + "Appeal to the middle class:" + "\n" + "1. No tithe to pay, so more $ for them." + "\n" + "2. Now they can read the Bible and interpret it in their own way." + "\n" + "3. Concept of individualism – you are your own priest. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. Other Forms That Were Produced From Protestanism " + "\n" + "• Zwingli: had beliefs very similar to Luther, except that he believed that none of the sacraments bestowed grace, and that they were purely symbolic. " + "\n" + "• Radicals: many radical sects broke out, and after Munster they were all persecuted. Since some believed that Baptism should only be administered to adults who asked to be baptized, they were all called the Anabaptists (rebaptisers)." + "\n" + "• Calvin: formed the second wave of the Reformation. Though Lutheranism and Calvinism both believed in people’s sinfulness, salvation by faith alone, that all people were equal in God’s eyes and that people should follow existing political authority, Calvin believed in predestination or the concept that God, being all knowing, already knows if a person is going to go to heaven and become part of the elect or not.

Existing System of Government in England" + "\n" + "• Local administration → members of the gentry (not technically members of the nobility, but still had large estates and were dominant political figures) were chosen to become JPs. The JPs were voluntary unpaid officials that served as the principal public servant in the more than forty counties. Since the gentry wanted appointments for reasons of status, the king could always count on their support." + "\n" + "• Lawmaking → though the Parliament grew in power, it always remained subordinate to the crown. Nevertheless, the English kings knew that they couldn’t take severe measures without its consent. The Parliament contributed to the unification of the country, even though it took away power from kings." + "\n" + "• Judiciary → the common law (based on the interpretations and precedents made by individual judges), not Roman law was in effect, and traveling judges administered it. This helped unify the country as well." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Changes made by Henry VII and Henry VIII" + "\n" + "• Henry VII → founder of the Tudor dynasty, Henry VII came to power shortly after the War of Roses, a civil war that weakened the nobles greatly. He was a conservative, and strengthened the crown by applying the traditional methods, such as:  " + "\n" + "• He carefully built up funds without overtaxing his subjects; he put collection and revenue in the hands of a small, efficient group of his officials. Avoided foreign entanglements." + "\n" + "• He increased the power of the JPs and had the Star Chamber (a group of royal councilors) resume hearing appeals, which strengthened royal power and decreased noble power because nobles could no longer control the local courts.  " + "\n" + "• In 1513 he beat invading Scottish army @ Flodden, near England’s north border." + "\n" + "• 2. Decided to break with the Roman Catholic Church after advice from Thomas Cromwell. This had the effect of stimulating the economy since church funds stayed in the country and the church lands were annexed. It also greatly strengthened the Parliament and gave it more responsibility. " + "\n" + "• 3. The break with the Church also had the effect of making a reorganization of the administration necessary. They made six departments, each with specific functions. Cromwell was the executive of the councils. A Privy Council was also established, consisting of the king’s advisers." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Existing System of Government in France" + "\n" + "• Local administration → there was no real system for local government, and aristocrats were virtually independent rulers until the new monarchs came along." + "\n" + "• Royal administration → had three departments: the Chancery (had charge of formal documents), the Treasury ($), and the Parlement of France (the court of law). Roman law was used, which helped the king because the monarch was then able to issue ordinances." + "\n" + "• Lawmaking → representative assemblies, known as Estates, limited the throne’s power because the estates had to approve measures made by the king before they were enacted. The throne was forced to negotiate with the estates, especially to raise taxes. Nevertheless, the Estates never were as powerful as the English Parliament. The taxes (the sales tax, hearth tax, and salt tax) all went to the crown and after 1451, they could be collected on the king’s authority alone. " + "\n" + "-Army: unlike the English, they had a standing army that was rarely used but always a threat, so it increased the king’s power. However, it took an enormous amount of funding." + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. Changes made by Louis XI and Charles VIII" + "\n" + "• Louis XI → began his reign after the Hundred Years War, which weakened the crown. At the beginning of his reign, there was anarchy, and the king had no power. However, changes he made reestablished the crown’s power. For example:" + "\n" + "• He beat Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy, who was Charles V great-grandfather and he then reannexed Burgundy except for the Low Countries, which the duke’s daughter kept. " + "\n" + "\n" + "V. Changes made by Louis XII, Francis I and Henri II" + "\n" + "• Louis XII → began reign after Charles VIII and before Francis I. He made many changes, including:" + "\n" + "• He increased the size and complexity of the administration." + "\n" + "• Adopted the sale of offices (simony) that stimulated social mobility and corruption." + "\n" + "• Due to the fact that the clergy and nobles were exempt from taxation, the crown was forced to rely on the lower classes, which couldn’t provide enough money to upkeep the standing army and the country. So, under Louis XII, the country began taking loans from banks (Fugger). " + "\n" + "• Gaining power over the Church with the Concordat of Bologna (1516), which allowed him to make appointments, and, though it was not stated, it effectively allowed him to control the Church without breaking from it (see Henry VIII)." + "\n" + "• He began a major reorganization of the government. He legalized the sale of offices, formed and inner council and centralized all tax gathering and accounting responsibilities in 1523. " + "\n" + "• He passed the lit de justice, which states that if an assembly is delaying passing a monarch’s law the monarch can then appear before the assembly and make it the law. " + "\n" + "• During his reign the Estates General stopped meeting and consequently lost influence." + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. Existing System of Government in Spain" + "\n" + "• The Iberian Peninsula was divided into three different sections, as follows:" + "\n" + "-Portugal: in midst of its overseas exploration." + "\n" + "-Castile: the largest and richest area. It was still fighting the Muslims on its Southern frontier. This led to nobles gaining a lot of political power." + "\n" + "-Aragon: small area same size as Portugal. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. Changes made by Ferdinand and Isabella" + "\n" + "• Although Ferdinand and Isabella made no attempt to form a monolithic state (all united) they did somewhat unify Spain into a federation where the nobles lost power." + "\n" + "• Aragon: remained a federation of territories administered by viceroys who were appointed by the king but allowed local customs to remain intact. Each province was allowed to keeps its own representative assembly, called the Cortes. " + "\n" + "• Castile: in Castile, they were determined to assert their superiority and restore order to the countryside (which was screwed up by civil wars). They did this by establishing the Cortes of Castile, an assembly dominated by urban representatives who shared the wish for order since peace helped trade. The Cortes also had tribunals to try criminals. " + "\n" + "• They overhauled the entire administration by saying that “ability rather than social status should determine appointments.” They kicked out the nobles as local administrators, and replaced them with people from a lesser class of nobility called the hidalgos (similar to gentry in England) who occupied positions called corregidors, which were local judicial officers. " + "\n" + "• Also, in 1478, the Pope granted them the power to have an independent Inquisition to kick out all non-Christians, such as the Muslims and Jews. Without other religions, Spain was more united. Plus, the Inquisition, like the Italian wars, kept the nobles busy. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VIII. The Holy Roman Empire under Charles V" + "\n" + "• Charles V was the king of Spain but the Cortes didn’t like him because he requested additional tax funds so that he could take the Spanish troops and try to unify the HRE. So, effectively, he wasted all of Spain’s $ from the new world on stupid wars! Naturally, when Charles V left for war, the poor people revolted but the nobles put down the rebellion before Charles V came back. The nobles sided against the peasants only because along with attacking Charles, they attacked the nobles. " + "\n" + "• After the uprising, he kept his administration entirely Spanish. While he was fighting outside wars, he relied entirely on a skilled administrator, Francisco de los Cobos, who enlarged the administration and the system of councils. He made two types of councils, one of each department of government and the other for each territory ruled. At the head was the Council of State. A federation emerged, like US. " + "\n" + "• Charles’ major problem was $ because he wasted all of it on his stupid wars (like the one against the Ottomans, and all the ones against the Schmalkaldic League in HRE) in Europe. Since Aragon was more independent, the entire tax burden fell on Castile, but Castile did get a monopoly of trade with the New World, which gave them lots of silver. However, the monopoly eventually led to foreign domination since no one else could get the $. Consequently, Philip II had to declare Spain bankrupt several times because of the wars.  "

Definition of the Scientific Revolution" + "\n" + "• The Scientific Revolution (1543 – 1687) was a period of time in which many breakthrough discoveries were made in science and philosophy, as well as an era in which the Europeans’ perception of the universe and their role in it was changed forever." + "\n" + "• Although the SR began by only affecting the scientific and intellectual elite (5 % of the population or so) the concepts that originated during the SR eventually spread to all of the population." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Before the Scientific Revolution" + "\n" + "• Prior to the SR, all scientific concepts came from either the Bible or ancient scientists. Since, during the Middle Ages, most of the works of other ancient scientists were lost, Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Galen became the only, and therefore ultimate, authorities, on their fields. The old beliefs came from:" + "\n" + "• The Bible: naturally, the main source of information, in all respects, was the Bible, whose teachings were taken literally (for example, if a story stated that the world stopped spinning, Europeans believed that the world actually did stop spinning)." + "\n" + "• Aristotle: was the greatest philosopher of ancient times. He was viewed as the absolute authority on physics, although many of his theories were wrong " + "\n" + "• Ptolemy: a great astronomer from ancient times, he stated that the earth was the center of the universe and that the sun and all the planets moved around in crystalline spheres. " + "\n" + "-Since this alone was not able to mathematically explain retrograde motion Ptolemy added in epicycles which, through some very complicated calculations, could approximate planetary motion." + "\n" + "• Galen: though his influence was far lesser than that of Aristotle and Ptolemy, Galen’s medical and anatomical theories dominated the scientific world for years even though they were proved wrong by dissections." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Causes of the Scientific Revolution" + "\n" + "• One cause was that scientists were simply beginning to take note of the inadequacies of the standard theories, and, although they greatly preferred to make slight changes to the theories some scientists were beginning to question the old authorities." + "\n" + "• Still, it is unlikely that the scientists would have challenged the established theories without the influence of the other ancient scientists, especially Archimedes, that disagreed with the old theories. " + "\n" + "• Another influence was the interest in what is now regarded as magic, but was then seen as serious science. " + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. The Major Scientific Discoveries" + "\n" + "• Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish priest and astronomer who shook the foundations of European beliefs. " + "\n" + "-He challenged Ptolemy’s system simply because it was too complex and he felt that there had to be a better system mathematically. So, based on mathematics, he developed a new, sun-centered system that placed earth as the third planet rotating around the sun. " + "\n" + "-Copernicus even began developing the concept of gravity, for he stated that large masses have their own attractive forces. However, he kept the crystalline spheres and did not account for the stars. His major work was: " + "\n" + "-The Revolution of Heavenly Bodies (start of scientific revolution), which, fearing the Church, he did not publish until his deathbed. The book sparked a major controversy" + "\n" + "• Giordano Bruno: made the mistake of openly supporting Copernicus and ridiculing the old philosophy; The church arrested him, and after his refusal to recant, burned him at the stake" + "\n" + "• Tycho Brahe: stargazer who meticulously recorded star data for years." + "\n" + "• Johann Kepler: a brilliant mathematician who developed the first theories of motion. With the aid of Brahe’s star data, Kepler came of with the theory that the planets moved in ellipses, and that they did not move at a steady rate." + "\n"  + "• Galileo Galilei: was the first scientist to use the telescope. With the telescope, he saw Jupiter’s moons (the existence of which proved that not everything orbited the earth, as was previously thought) and the craters on the moon (which proved that heaven was not perfect" + "\n" + "-So, in 1632, he wrote the Dialogue on the Two Great World Systems; But this did not fool the church, for they forced him to recant in 1633 and made him spend the last years of his life under house arrest. " + "\n" + "-Galileo is really considered to be the first modern scientist, for he developed the scientific method of experimentation and was one of the first mechanists" + "\n" + "• Isaac Newton: brought to a climax all the previous works in his masterpiece, The Principia, which described three laws of motion " + "\n" + "\n" + "V. The New Epistemologies" + "\n" + "• Became more widespread, especially through Galileo and Newton. The opposite philosophy to mechanism is teleology, which stated that everything is made for a purpose, and was used by Aristotle. " + "\n" + "• Mainly, however, the discoveries helped the scientific method develop. The scientific method, which was a new theory on how to obtain and verify knowledge, stressed experience, reason, and doubt and rejected all authority. The scientific method revolutionized science, and made measurement of data, and mathematics, essential parts of science. " + "\n" + "• The scientific method was actually a combination of two theories of knowledge:" + "\n" + "• Empiricism (a.k.a. induction) → was advocated by Francis Bacon (who wrote New Atlantis a description of an ideal society based on science) and supported going from particular knowledge (observation) to general knowledge." + "\n" + "• Rationalism advocated by Rene Descartes who stated that senses can lie and that the only way to find truth was to start from one fact " + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. The Famous Empiricists" + "\n" + "• Empiricism was a very influential epistemology, and soon, it was beginning to be applied to other fields, not just science. Actually, several individuals used empiricism to develop political theories." + "\n" + "• Thomas Hobbes: was a radical Nominalist who stated that there are no abstract ideas; did not believe in abstract good or evil. " + "\n" + "-Hobbes’ absolute monarchy is not based on divine right, but, instead, it is based on a social contract in which the people agree that, since anything is better than the war of all-against-all, they will give up their natural rights to the government in exchange for protection. " + "\n" + "• John Locke: the next significant empiricist, he was somewhat a reaction to Hobbes’ negativity. " + "\n" + "-Locke began with the assumption that, at birth, each person is born with a tabula rasa (blank slate) and that all human nature and knowledge comes from either direct experience or from reflection. " + "\n" + "-Locke stated people are neutral, since it all depends on the environment; each person has certain inalienable rights of life, liberty and property; government is formed, to protect the rights; government must protect peoples’ rights, but not more, and the people must obey the government so long as it does not do more than necessary; if it does, people have the right to rebel and establish another government. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. The Effects of the Scientific Revolution" + "\n" + "• People felt that human understanding of the universe could be reduced to mathematical laws." + "\n" + "• The universe was no longer appeared to be a mystery. In fact, people felt that it was orderly, rational, and, most importantly, could be understood by humans." + "\n" + "• Natural laws: similar to the laws found in science by Newton, could govern other aspects of life as well, such as economics, politics, or ethics. " + "\n" + "• Positive effects: gain of knowledge, greater toleration, less superstition and more scientific answers, and freedom to deviate from established theories, which opened the door for new developments" + "\n" + "• Negative effects: loss of innocence, loss of traditional faith, loss of faith in heaven, earth is no longer regarded as the center skepticism, loss of personal/caring God." + "\n" + "\n" + "VIII. The Arts During the Scientific Revolution" + "\n" + "• Mannerism: Mannerism featured distorted human figures, strange perspectives and unnatural colors and lighting. " + "\n" + "• Baroque: reflected the desire for grandeur and the wish to inspire and awe people with God’s greatness. " + "\n" + "-Other famous baroque painters were Rubens and Veláquez who glorified church figures and rulers. Bernini, a baroque sculptor and architect, did the inside and outside of St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rome.      " + "\n" + "• Classicism: like Baroque, Classicism attempted to awe the viewer. However, like the Renaissance, it attempted to awe the viewer with form and discipline – also they wished to return to ancient values. Big guy was Poussin whose paintings were more subdued than the baroque guys (he liked togas).      " + "\n" + "\n" + "IX. The Literature During the Scientific Revolution" + "\n" + "• Michel de Montaigne: invented the essay (what did he have to do that for?); influenced by skepticism which eventually led to search for self-knowledge and his belief that acting righteously is more important than following doctrine " + "\n" + "• Cervantes: wrote Don Quixote, which illustrated the wide gaps between rich and poor and the difference between reality and fantasy of his time by poking fun at society and politics Shakespeare: wrote plays that made timeless statements about human behavior and covered a very wide range of topics and emotions. " + "\n" + "• Corneille:  was the dominant French playwright of the 1600s whose work reflects the rise of classicism. At first, he refused to follow the three new set rules for drama (unity of time, location and plot). His masterpiece was Le Cid"

Demographic Change" + "\n" + "• Prior to the eighteenth century, the levels of populations seemed to flow in cyclical, or wave-like patterns, depending on natural phenomena such as crop failures, plagues, etc." + "\n" + "• Around 1730, a new era in Europe’s demography began. During the 18th century; " + "\n" + "-Europe’s population skyrocketed, jumping from 120 to 190 million. Prussia, Sweden, Spain, France, and especially England experienced tremendous population increases during this period. " + "\n" + "-After this time, the cyclic behavior of the populations stopped, and Europe’s population simply continued to increase. " + "\n" + "• The rapid population growth was, according to historians, caused by a decline in mortality rates in all the countries except for England. The decline in mortality rates occurred b/c Europe began to enjoy a more stable and better food supply " + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Economic Growth" + "\n" + "• During the 18th century, overall wealth also increased, although the growth was not consistent. Still, the overall trend was a positive one. " + "\n" + "• Significant growth began around 1730 and continued until 1815. This period was characterized by gradual price inflation " + "\n" + "- The growth, however, did not affect all sectors of society in the same way. Though the gradual increase in prices was good for landlords, employers, merchants, and landed peasants, it was very bad for the poor, landless peasants, who could barely afford to live." + "\n" + "• Protoindustrialization led to increased manufacturing and population growth in rural areas. Additionally, it strengthened marketing networks, helped merchants get more $ " + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Changes in Industry"
                + "\n" + "• Though, during the 18th century, most industries remained the same, dramatic change was beginning to occur, especially in the manufacturing of cotton cloth. The changes in industry were meant to increase the productivity of labor through new technologies. " + "\n" + "• Increases in performance: before Europeans could change the format of industry, they had to face major obstacles and make changes that affected the very structure of European society. " + "\n" + "-Europeans faced many difficulties as they attempted to change the structure of the economy, such as:" + "\n" + "-Small Market Size: since European countries were cut off from one another for both physical and political reasons, merchants were forced to deal with very limited markets. This slowed the growth of specialized manufacturing and limited the mobility of capital and labor. " + "\n" + "-Skewed Distribution of Wealth → since the aristocracy used most of the income, merchants would cater to their desires and make small quantities of luxury goods, as opposed to lots of cheap goods that would be accessible to the public. This screwed up supply and demand. " + "\n" + "-Property Rights/Privileges → these traditional institutions worked against innovation, as rents and tolls often sucked up capital that would otherwise be available to both would-be consumers (peasants) and the entrepreneurs (merchants).   " + "\n" + "-Guild/Government Regulations → were huge problems for the merchants. As the guild regulations established a standard, traditional procedure for industry, which was not be changed, they made innovation exceedingly difficult. Government restrictions on economic activity and licensing of monopolies only made it more difficult for merchants. " + "\n" + "-Cultural Attitudes → as many Europeans, especially the nobles, still regarded $ as dirty and simply wanted to have their titles, going into business was discouraged. " + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Laissez-Faire Economics" + "\n"
                + "• Many Europeans began to question and criticize the barriers that prevented further industrialization and innovation. They called for less control of the economy. " + "\n" + "• Adam Smith: a Scottish philosopher who epitomized the concerns and desires of the age, and wrote An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations " + "\n" + "-Smith believed that $ was not actually wealth, but only showed it, and that real wealth consisted of the added value of manufactured items produced by invested capital. Most importantly, however, he stated that economic progress required that each individual be allowed to pursue his/her self-interest freely w/out restrictions for this would lead to economic growth. " + "\n" + "• Laissez-faire economics really caught on, especially in England, and in 1786 France and Britain signed a free-trade treaty. Guilds were growing weaker, and in 1791, the French got rid of them. In the 1790s, the English also began to pass laws against them, and the merchants gained freedom. " + "\n" + "\n"
                + "IV. England Begins to Industrialize" + "\n" + "• England was the first nation to develop a social structure supportive of innovation and economic growth. So, why was it England? This is b/c of many advantages, such as:" + "\n" + "-Geography: England was close to the sea, which allowed trade w/foreign nations and colonies. Also, England had two great resources essential to industry, iron and coal, as well as a lot of good, productive farmlands." + "\n" + "-Existing Capital to Invest → the English began with a store of capital from the colonies, which led to the creation of a banking and investing system – the Bank of England – in 1694. The bank took responsibility of England’s public dept, sold shares to the public, and met the interest payments for shareholders. This helped stabilize the markets. " + "\n" + "-Free Trade → the English had markets in their colonies, the other European powers (free trade agreement w/ France in 1786) and the Spanish colonies b/c of the Treaty of Utrecht." + "\n" + "-Labor Supply → slavery, cheap labor (peasants) due to the Enclosure Acts, which drove the peasants out of the communal farmlands and made them look for work. " + "\n" + "\n" + "V. Cotton Begins Industrialization" + "\n"
                + "• Since England had developed a social structure supportive of industrialization, all it needed was a take off industry, or an industry that would begin a pattern of industrialization all the others would follow. In England’s case, this industry was cotton manufacturing. " + "\n" + "• Due to the slave labor in the plantations, there was a very large supply of raw cotton. There was also a very high demand for the durable, cheap cotton goods. However, the putting-out system had reached its limits in productions, so merchants were ready to take the next step towards industrialization. " + "\n" + "• James Watt: inventor of the steam engine. Arkwright asked Watt to use steam engines to drive his spinning machines, and the first factories were created.  " + "\n" + "• The cotton industry was revolutionized by the 19th century, for goods could be made incredibly fast, and merchants could house all their workers in factories and watch them work. " + "\n" + "\n"
                + "VI. Changes in Agriculture" + "\n" + "• In England, many peasants were able to leave the country and go to the city, where they found work as factory laborers, because of the new agricultural techniques, which caused an increase in efficiency and productivity." + "\n" + "• Convertible Husbandry: instead of letting land lie unused every second or third year " + "\n" + "• Charles Townshend: innovator who proved the value of planting turnips instead of resting land." + "\n" + "• Enclosure Movement: throughout Europe, all towns shared communal lands, which were divided into small plots. This made it very difficult to change agricultural techniques, since the village as a whole had to agree to a certain technique. " + "\n" + "• But, in England, Parliament was able enclose all the land in a village, even against the will of the village itself. In the end, the communal field system was practically eradicated in England, leading to the domination of rural society by great landlords and their tenant farmers. Enclosure also forced many peasants to leave for the cities, where they could then find work. "

" + "\n" + "- During the Enlightenment, all the trademark aspects of European society were exposed to criticism and analysis through reason. No institution was spared, for even the church itself was attacked by the cynical philosophs. Though the Enlightenment began as a movement that only reached the intellectual elite of society, its repercussions would eventually reach and have a big impact on society as a whole. " + "\n" + "\n" + "II. The Beliefs of the Philosophs" + "\n" + "- The philosophs, a group of intellectuals who supported the ideals of the Enlightenment, stood for a series of beliefs, which they stood for, regardless of the cost. These ideas included:" + "\n" + "1. Reason → the universe can be explained through reason, as can all human institutions. The philosophs thought that reason could be applied to everything, and that it could be used to correct the problems in society." + "\n" + "2. Skepticism → the philosophs believed that everything should be open to questioning and criticism, even religion. They disliked dogma, superstition, and blind faith." + "\n" + "3. Toleration → both religious and intellectual. They felt that all ideas were equally valid, and that people should have the freedom to express themselves and their ideas. " + "\n" + "4. Freedom → that is, intellectual freedom, an idea closely linked to toleration. They felt that people should have free speech, press, and freedom of religion. They felt that each person should have the opportunity to reason things out for themselves." + "\n" + "5. Equality → based on Locke’s Tabula Raza – all people are equal." + "\n" + "6. Education → again, based on Locke. They believed that education could eventually lead to a perfect society, a paradise of reason and toleration." + "\n" + "7. Optimism → very optimistic, believed in science bringing progress. " + "\n" + "8. Enlightened Despotism → for many kings, enlightened despotism (“I am ruling b/c I can be a servant of the state and bring the enlightenment to my people”) replaced divine right monarchy and other justifications for ruling." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. The Famous Philosophs" + "\n" + "- Voltaire is often regarded as the leading figure of the Enlightenment. A talented writer, Voltaire stood for many of the ideals of the period. First of all, he greatly admired science and helped to popularize it. In 1738, he wrote Elements of the Philosophy of Newton, which attempted to make Newton’s discoveries understandable. Voltaire greatly admired the English, for he felt their society had allowed greats like Locke, Bacon and Newton to rise, and in 1734 he wrote the Philosophical Letters on the English, which celebrated English toleration. Also, Voltaire absolutely hated religion (actually he didn’t hate religion per se, but he really hated intolerance) and he wrote The Philosophical Dictionary in 1764, which stated that organized religion bred intolerance and superstition. Voltaire was a deist, and felt religion should be a private matter. Throughout his life, Voltaire faced persecution and censorship, and as a result, he was a dedicated advocator of intellectual and religious freedom. Voltaire was a brilliant satirical writer (Candide) and literary critic who poked fun at every element of society (which is why all his books were banned). " + "\n" + "- Baron de Montesquieu → wrote The Spirit of the Laws a book that described an ideal system of government using checks and balances. He believed that societies and political institutions could be studied scientifically, and that a balanced government would lead to success. " + "\n" + "- David Hume → he was the empiricism who made that stupid argument about the tree falling in the forest. He hated dogma, and I mean really hated it. He went around proving how everybody was wrong. He was an atheist and he didn’t believe in any general knowledge, so who knows what he did believe in. Anyhow, he wrote Inquiry into Human Nature that criticized Christianity.  " + "\n" + "- Cesare Beccaria → was an economist and penal reformer who wrote On Crimes and Punishments, which argued for human rights and humanitarianism." + "\n" + "\n" + "The Elite Culture of the Enlightenment:" + "\n" + "- During the Enlightenment, many new forms of elite culture developed. These developments had hardly any effect on the majority of the people, but the elite culture, united by French as a common language, bound together into a cosmopolitan world." + "\n" + "- First of all, the elite began to travel around Europe. They looked at the cultural centers and cities, as well as the ancient monuments of antiquity. Cities were being spruced up during this time with the additions of amenities (like streetlights and public transportation) and two important new ideas, coffeehouses (where people could eat and talk) and shop windows (sparked commerce).  " + "\n" + "- A so-called republic of letters began to develop (popularized by Pierre Bayle, who like religious toleration), in which journals and newspapers circulated among the elite. Though the republic was limited to the educated, all classes and backgrounds could join in. The elite also met in salons (philosophical party houses of the elite, very snobby and stylish) and academies both of which helped spread ideas and unite people. There, people could dispute their ideas and come up w/new ones." + "\n" + "\n" + "*Popular Culture during the Enlightenment" + "\n" + "- Popular culture was pretty much totally separate from the elite culture, and was not really that affected by it at all. At this level culture was still public recreation and oral tradition. " + "\n" + "- There was, however, some popular literature meant to be read aloud in the community. This consisted of religious material, almanacs, and literature for fun (stories). Mainly, popular writing actually fostered submissiveness, not rebellion, for it had a fatalistic acceptance of the status quo. " + "\n" + "- But the most important part of popular culture was the oral tradition, which consisted of the folktales and songs passed from generation to generation. These tales expressed the hardships and goals of the time, with themes like struggles to survive and magical happenings." + "\n" + "- Lastly, popular culture included festivals and taverns (the salons for normal people) where common people could enjoy themselves and relax. Sports also became important during this time, and people began to attend sporting events more.  "

The Prelude to the Revolution: " + "\n" + "- So, when Louis XVI took the throne in 1774, the monarchy was in a pretty bad shape economically.  - Turgot (finance minister) tried to make reforms to fix the situation (like removing government restrictions on commerce, cutting down court expenses, and replacing the obligation of peasants to work on royal roads with a small tax on all landholders) but this made him unpopular with the nobles. " + "\n" + "• Louis kicked Turgot out and replaced him with Necker who avoided new taxes, which made him popular, but took out huge loans instead, which was bad for the economy. After a while things were so screwed up that the new finance guy, Calonne, rightly stated that the monarchy was on the verge of bankruptcy." + "\n" + "- Naturally Louis got rid of Calonne and appointed Archbishop Brienne (one of the notables) in his place. Brienne submitted Calonne’s ideas to the Parlements, but they rejected them. Then they demanded that Louis convene the Estates General. Louis responded by attempting to send the Parlement into exile, but was forced to back down. " + "\n"
                + "\n" + "III. The Estates General:" + "\n" + "• As the word spread that the EG were going to meet, the liberal ideology began to take shape. People against tradition (they didn’t needed to be lower class, necessarily) came to be known as patriots. " + "\n" + "• The first big issue was the method of voting for the EG. The Third Estate, representing 95% of population" + "\n" + "• Before the EG, the king invited the citizens to elect delegates to assemblies. All male taxpayers could vote for electors, who, in turn, chose reps for the Third Estate of the EG. Also, he asked citizens to write grievance petitions – cahiers. " + "\n" + "\n"
                + "IV. The National Assembly:" + "\n" + "• May 5th, 1789: the EG finally met, for the first time since 1614. But the king only spoke generally and didn’t clear up the voting mess. " + "\n" + "• June 17th, 1789: the Third Estate had enough and proclaimed itself the National Assembly. A few days later, most of the clergy joined. The king decided to support the dumb nobles and locked the Third Estate out of its meeting hall. " + "\n" + "• Tennis Court Oath: on June 20th, the Revolutionaries went to a tennis court and swore that they wouldn’t separate until they had given France a constitution. " + "\n"
                + "• The king responded by promising equality in taxation, civil liberties, and regular meetings of the EG but voting would be by order. Then, he ordered the estates to go to their individual meeting halls, but the TE didn’t go. Finally, he recognized the NA told all the estates to join it. But, he secretly was ordering 20,000 royal troops to the Paris region. " + "\n" + "• July 14th, 1789: fearing counter-revolution Parisian crowds attacked the Bastille, the 20,000 troops joined (on Rev side), and the Revolutionaries won. At the same time, royal officials in Paris were ousted and were replaced w/a Revolutionary municipality, and a citizens’ militia was formed. " + "\n" + "• Starvation and rumors caused The Great Fear in which the peasants attacked nobles and revolted. " + "\n" + "• August 26th, 1789: NA writes The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen as the constitution will take a long time to finish. " + "\n"
                + "• In 1790, they passed this law that forced clergy to become state employees and take oaths of loyalty to state. 50% clergy obeyed, other 50% didn’t, and the pope condemned the action, so many religious people were alienated. " + "\n" + "• Constitution of 1791: finally, in 1791, the constitution was finished. It established a limited monarchy w/a clear separation of powers. There was a unicameral legislature elected by indirect voting. " + "\n" + "\n" + "V. The Legislative Assembly: " + "\n" + "- After the constitution was finished, the NA gave way to the Legislative Assembly. B/c of the Self Denying Ordinance, no NA members could be in the LA. " + "\n" + "- Just as the first LA is about to go into effect, the king escapes; In his unsuccessful Flight to Varennes he tries to escape, but is captured. LA decides to keep him anyway, and they go on as if nothing had happened even though everything is messed up. " + "\n" + "- August 10th, 1792 → then, b/c of the Brunswick Manifesto the Parisian militants decided to storm the royal palace at the Tulieries. They drove the king from the throne, the LA declared him suspended, and then half the LA escaped as well. Now, without the king, the LA was also illegitimate.   "
                + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. The Radical Phase" + "\n" + "- So, a new government had to be established, as the constitutional monarchy, w/out a monarch, had lost its legitimacy. Temporarily, a Paris Commune or city government was created. But this was not enough to maintain order, and in September, hysteria spread by the radical journalists resulted in the September Massacres, in which popular tribunals summarily executed thousands of prisoners, who were feared to be counter-revolutionaries. " + "\n" + "- The hysteria began to fade when the French won at the Battle of Valmy on September 20th. Then, France was declared a Republic, and a National Convention met for the first time. " + "\n" + "- Constitution of 1793 → although this constitution was never put into effect because of the military crisis, in addition to confirming the individual rights laid out in the last constitution (plus the rights of public assistance, education, and even of rebellion to resist oppression), it provided for a legislature elected by the people (men only though) that would also elect the executive.  " + "\n" + "- The Jacobins swept aside the new constitution, declaring the government “revolutionary until the peace” and instituting the Reign of Terror. A twelve-man committee, the Committee for Public Safety, was in charge, and the main leaders of the Committee were Robespierre, Danton, and the ultra radical Hébert. " + "\n"
                + "- During the ROT, the French were fighting the foreign wars, and, soon enough, with the strict discipline of the ROT, they began to win. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. The Thermidorian Reaction: " + "\n" + "- After the fall of Robespierre, the revolutionary committees that had led the ROT were destroyed, the Paris Jacobin Club was closed, and the Convention offered an amnesty to the remaining Girondins. The term Thermidorian Reaction refers to the return of conservatism after the ultra-radical phase in the FR and is now applied to any such pattern in other revolutions. " + "\n" + "- The anti-Jacobin sentiment grew so strong, in fact, that a White Terror erupted against anyone connected with the Jacobins. The social austerity of the old calendar was back, the fancy titles, and all that stuff made their return." + "\n" + "- The last revolutionary uprising occurred in 1795, when the sans-culottes launched a poorly organized revolt and, after two days of street fighting, were overwhelmed by the government. " + "\n" + "- In 1795, a new constitution was drafted. It proclaimed a general amnesty and set up a five man executive committee known as the Directory. It also had a two-house legislature. The Directory attempted to stay on the moderate side of everything, and it became incredibly corrupt! It had to overthrow itself after the first general election because a royalist majority won, and things only got worse. By 1799 any semblance of legitimacy was gone, making way for Napoleon"

Although it was more an attitude towards life than it was a philosophy, it did have some defining characteristics" + "\n" + "• was almost a counterpoint to the ideals of the Enlightenment, which were then associated with liberalism and the middle class." + "\n" + "• could coexist w/other political philosophies, for example nationalism or socialism." + "\n" + "• conservatives and radicals both drew on romantic philosophy, for conservatives claimed that stability was only possible through tradition and respect of customs while radicals claimed that a new era required the shattering of old institutions just as artistic change required new creativity." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Romanticism vs. Liberalism: " + "\n" + "- Romanticism was a movement that idealized the countryside, liberalism thrived in the cities." + "\n" + "- Romanticism emphasized emotion, the heart, and poetry (often illogical and emotional) while liberalism emphasized reason, the mind, and prose (logical and unemotional)." + "\n" + "- Romanticism stressed intuition, and the concept of genius while liberalism stressed reason and scholarship (you must study and work to improve yourself" + "\n" + "- Romanticism viewed nature as untamable, irrational, and out of control. They felt that nature controlled humans, not visa versa. Liberalism felt nature could be controlled, and, most importantly, understood through mathematical laws – it stressed progress." + "\n" + "- Romanticism stressed the uniqueness of the individual while liberalism stressed the fact that humans control own destiny, that perfection can be reached through education, progress and science and that there are universal human laws." + "\n"
                + "- Romanticism idealized the Middle Ages (knights in shining armor) while liberalism despised it." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Romantic Philosophy and Literature" + "\n" + "- Although romantic thought flourished with the revival of religion, the increased interest in history and rising nationalism, it was mainly philosophical." + "\n" + "- Romantic thinkers wrote about metaphysics, aesthetics, the philosophy of nature, and even (in Germany and Scandinavia) a romantic philosophy of science." + "\n" + "- Romantics tended to express themselves through poetry, aphorisms, and autobiographical accounts." + "\n" + "- Friedrich Schiegel → was a very influential romantic thinker from Germany." + "\n" + "- Samuel Taylor Coleridge → was an English romantic poet who wrote the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a tale of guilt, redemption, and the supernatural." + "\n" + "- William Wordsworth → another romantic poet whose poems contrasted the beauty of nature with urban corruption and denounced the materialism of his age." + "\n" + "- In general, novelists and dramatists began to set their tales in the past, favor vivid description and attempt to describe the larger picture of human existence (like Shakespeare and Cervantes)." + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. Romantic Art and Music" + "\n" + "- In art, the romantic painters began to emphasize color over line, scenes of nature (especially wild nature), exotic scenes, movement, action, dark backgrounds, turmoil, and an appeal to emotion." + "\n" + "- The romantic style was almost the opposite of the last great style, neoclassicism."
                    + "\n" + "- Romantic portraits (which were out anyhow) were blurry and tried to show inner personality." + "\n" + "- Big guys were Delacroix (French painter who did Greece Expiring and Liberty Leading the People), Goya (Spanish painter) and Turner (English painter who did The Slave Ship)." + "\n" + "- At the same time a competing school of painting, realism, emphasized ordinary, common people and scenes from everyday life." + "\n" + "- Neoclassicism was not completely gone either, for Delacroix’s artistic enemy was Ingres (a student of david who emphasized detail, crisp focus and blended neoclassicism with romantic influence)." + "\n" + "- In music romantic composers appealed directly to the heart, stressing melodies and using freer harmonies. Big romantic composers were Schubert and Schumann. " + "\n" + "\n" + "V. Political Ideologies" + "\n" + "- Almost all the “isms” of the nineteenth century (Romanticism, Liberalism, Nationalism, Socialism, Conservatism, and Radicalism) came from either the Enlightenment or the French Revolution (or as a reaction to the French Revolutions)."
                    + "\n" + "- Conservatism → conservatives tended to justify the status quo, defend tradition and hierarchy, and stress the limitations of human understanding. Conservatism arose mainly from Edmund Burke, and Englishman who stated that society exists through a continuity of the traditions that have developed over the years. Although Burke allowed for gradual change in theory, he mainly supported established institutions. Other conservatives, Joseph de Maistre and Louis de Bonald stated that society, in order to preserve itself, had to keep close control on dangerous ideas of reform.  " + "\n" + "- Liberalism → political liberalism, which originated with Locke and Enlightenment, was associated with ideas of social progress, economic development and the middle class. Liberals hoped to achieve a free society governed by a constitution that valued individual rights. John Stuart Mill was the most important liberal spokesman of the nineteenth century – he supported freedom of thought, universal suffrage and collective action by workers. " + "\n" + "- Economic Liberalism → although many liberals were also economic liberals, the two groups were not necessarily equivalent. Economic liberals always supported laissez-faire. David Ricardo, an Englishman who wrote the Principle of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), extended Smith’s ideology. He stated that a product’s value results from the labor required to make it, and emphasized labor saving as the source of profit. Also, he said that economic laws governed prices, such as the iron law of wages (which applied the law of supply and demand to labor). " + "\n" + "- Utilitarianism → the call for social reform led to utilitarianism, which stressed the role of the state in society. One influential utilitarian was Jeremy Benthan, and Englishman who dismissed the doctrine of natural rights as a meaningless abstraction and, instead, proposed that utility should guide public policy. With good being that which give the most people pleasure and the bad being than which gives the most people pain, Benthan stated that self-interest could also guide public policy.  " + "\n"
                    + "- Socialism → socialist despised the competitive spirit of capitalism and advocated a society in which people could live harmoniously and could be truly free. The early socialists – Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen – were late called utopian socialists by Marx b/c they attempted to found ideal communities in which everyone cooperated for the public benefit." + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. The Structure of Society" + "\n" + "- By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the original social pyramid structure of society was being transformed into different, more fluid, classes – and social relationships were becoming matters of contact between individuals. The classes were as follows:" + "\n" + "• Aristocracy → although the aristocrats did lost much of their influence, they remained a potent force throughout Europe. The aristocracy continued to control most of the wealth of the country and still dominated the administration and the military. The aristocrats held on to more power in the south and east, though, for, there, they in effect had control over the peasant masses.   " + "\n" + "• Peasants → most Europeans were peasants. The peasants felt the effects of change as agriculture became more commercial (profits increased) and technology changed, but the big change for most peasants was the emancipation of the peasants from feudal obligations, which encouraged peasants to enter the commercial market. But, on the other hand, the decline of local industries (putting-out system) made the peasants even more dependent on small plots of land. In general, peasants stuck by tradition, although they could also become major political forces in some cases." + "\n" + "• Workers → a new class, the industrial workers lived dependent on their employers and often made barely enough to keep alive. They often lived in dirty slums, with special restrictions on their rights, etc. Workers were clearly an emerging political force in society, one the upper classes (rightly) feared. But, although there were attempts to make organized labor movements, for the most part, the vast majority of the working class remained defenseless without the skills to organize well." + "\n" + "• Artisans/Skilled Workers → the most independent workers, the artisans continued to live by a hierarchy of masters and apprentices. They did benefit from industrialization, and, unlike the factory workers, did have the organization and education to organize effectively to improve conditions." + "\n" + "• Middle Class→ the most confident and assertive class, the middle class ranged from the great bankers to the petit bourgeoisie (clerks, shopkeepers, etc.) and was held together by shared ideals and common interests 97 all were opposed to special privileges and saw themselves as the beneficiaries of careers open to talent. Essentially an urban class, they liked to see themselves as self-made. They were associated with the liberal ideology of the time, and pushed for moderation." + "\n" + "- During this time, the population also increased (due to fewer diseases, increased food supply and a lower of the age at which people married) and cities grew greatly." + "\n" + "- This in turn led to terrible conditions in the cities, and efforts to improve them through charities and government laws concerning public welfare." + "\n" + "- Charity was mainly conducted by the middle class and the very religious, and mostly by women." + "\n" + "-Although the charities helped a few, they were not sufficient, and government intervention was required to fix the situation. By mid-century, housing and sanitary codes regulated most cities." + "\n" + "- Later, governments also began to regulate child labor and stop vagrancy. Education became a matter of national policy as well, and most countries established compulsory public schooling." + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. The Spread of Liberal Government" + "\n" + "- As liberal social programs spread throughout Europe, England became the model for many aspiring liberal nations. But England itself had passed through a time of reform and change." + "\n" + "- Between 1688 and 1832 there was no reform at all in England b/c the English were afraid reform might open the gates for a revolution like in France." + "\n" + "- By the late eighteenth century England desperately needed reform, but would-be reformers like Tom" + "\n" + "- England had an archaic system of government: only 500 people were elected to the House of Commons through the Burrows (which were totally corrupt – “pocket burrows”), there was total misrepresentation (new cities like Manchester had no reps) and it was all in all really unfair." + "\n" + "- Finally, in 1832 the Reform Bill was passed, which extended the franchise from 500,000 to 800,000 votes (which allowed upper MC to vote), and redistricted (more proportional representation). This was a big deal b/c it signaled the beginning of the end for the gentry 97 now the middle class was taking over and gaining control of the government." + "\n" + "- After 1832 new reforms such as the Factory Act (limiting hours of child labor) and the Poor Law were passed, and finally a law granting all resident taxpayers the right to vote in municipal elections." + "\n" + "- Still, more reforms were pushed for by the masses. One big issue was the Corn Laws (tariff on agricultural goods), which the landowners liked (can raise prices, more $) but middle class and working class despised (food prices up). So middle and working classes joined against gentry. In 1846 the laws were repealed (a final proof of the switch in power to the middle class). The Test Act was also repealed around this time." + "\n" + "\n" + "VIII. The Revolutions of 1830" + "\n" + "- In 1830, revolution swept across Europe, beginning with the abdication of Charles X in France, which sparked off minor revolts in central Italy, Spain, Portugal, some German states, and Poland. But Austria and Russia once again crushed most of the revolutions." + "\n" + "- France: Charles X didn’t like the elections, so he passed the July Ordinances (which cancelled elections, upped censorship, and called for new elections), which resulted in the people taking to the streets in revolution, Charles running away, " + "\n" + "-Lafayette bringing Louis Philippe from Orleans as the new king. The new reign, known as the July Monarchy, emphasized moderation – the regime began w/a new constitution presented as a contract that guaranteed individual rights, etc. The July Monarchy attempted to identify w/the middle class" + "\n" + "-Louis called himself the citizen king. But the monarchy didn’t please anyone b/c it attempted to please everyone, so, naturally, nobody was satisfied." + "\n" + "- during this time Guizot (a moderate liberal who spoke of liberty and progress but did nothing) skillfully dominated the government." + "\n" + "- Belgium: the Belgians (Catholics) followed the French revolted against the Dutch Protestants. They established a liberal constitutional monarchy and became a prosperous small country." + "\n" + "- Spain: in Spain, the monarchy supported the liberals. In 1833, however, the monarchy was threatened by a conservative uprising (the Carlists). So, to win support more support from the liberals, the monarchy granted a constitution in 1834."

Although, at first, they appeared to be spectacularly successful, in the end, all the revolutions failed." + "\n" + "• In general, revolutions occurred where governments were distrusted and where the fear and resentment fed by rising food prices and unemployment found focus in political demands." + "\n" + "• In the end, the revolutions failed b/c the revolutionaries found themselves divided, and also, as Seaman states, because the original governments still had the power and will to survive. " + "\n" + "• Sometimes 1848 is referred to as “the turning point at which modern history failed to turn” because it seemed as though the revolutionaries were only so close to success. " + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Revolution in France:" + "\n" + "• Started in France b/c of a small issue about suffrage. When the government refused to widen suffrage, the parliamentary opposition launched a protest movement that staged large banquets across the country. " + "\n" + "• The government banned the banquet scheduled for Paris in late February 1848, but some deputies said they would attend anyway, sparking a popular rebellion – barricades formed, the whole deal." + "\n" + "• Louis Philippe responded by reviewing his National Guard, they refused to cheer him, LP realized he had no support and abdicated in favor of his grandson and left for England.

" + "\n" + "• But the new regime didn’t want to go overboard – it rejected intervention on behalf of other revolutions, didn’t use the red flag, and added new taxes. Relations w/the church were great, nearly 85% of the people voted, moderate republicans won" + "\n" + "• The workers, however, were not satisfied and agitated for a social program and pinned their hopes on the program of national workshops that had been established " + "\n" + "-Now the workers were really ticked off, and they responded by building barricades. For three days they fought viciously against the republic’s troops (led by General Cavaignac) but were crushed in the bloody time known as the June Days.

" + "\n" + "• December, there was an election and Louis Napoleon Bonaparte won w/70% of the votes b/c of his name, which meant glory and stability. Bonaparte later changed the government to an empire w/himself as emperor just like his uncle, the original Napoleon. Revolution failed"

Revolution in Austria:" + "\n" + "• In the Austrian Empire, the Hungarians had by mid-March established a free press and a national guard and had abolished feudal obligations and special privileges. " + "\n" + "• This Hungarian example caused students in Vienna to demand representative government for Austria as well " + "\n" + "• Hungarian autonomy caused similar demands from the Czechs in Bohemia, the Croatians in Croatia, and the Romanians in Transylvania.

At first, the revolutions were successful, and all the states got constitutions (Napes, Tuscany, Piedmont, even Papal States)." + "\n" + "• Lombardy and Venetia had been part of the Hapsburg Empire, but after the revolution in Vienna, a revolt broke out in Milan against the Austrian forces there. In the Five Glorious Days of Milan the Austrians were forced to retreat. The Venetian republic was reestablished, and Piedmont joined the war against Austria as well. " + "\n" + "- Austria came back and beat Piedmont and its allies, leaving Austria back in firm control.

The Effects of Revolution:" + "\n" + "• Although none of the revolutions succeeded, they had a lasting impact on Europe. " + "\n" + "• The widespread revolutions measured the failures of restoration, once again demonstrated the power of political ideas, and uncovered the effects of a generation of social change. " + "\n" + "• Several gains, in fact, did endure: peasants in Prussia and Austria were emancipated, Piedmont and Prussia kept their new constitutions, and monarchs learned they needed to watch public opinion. " + "\n" + "• Liberals learned that they couldn’t depend on the masses to follow them w/out making demands, they reevaluated their own goals – perhaps the old order was better than anarchy, they thought. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VII. Nationalism: " + "\n" + "• Nationalism’s roots stem from a shared sense of regional and cultural identity, but the French Revolution and the effects of Napoleon’s conquests really caused it to emerge as a force in Europe. " + "\n" + "• Nationalism was also a movement towards modernization, as countries attempted to industrialize in order to compete with other nations and tried to modernize their political systems. " + "\n" + "• As an intellectual movement, nationalism also emphasized the importance of culture and cultural uniqueness. It rejected the universality of the Enlightenment and stated that each country had its own unique values and was suited to its own system of government. Many thinkers (like German nationalists Herder and Gottlieb) urged their countrymen to celebrate their cultural values. " + "\n" + "Two different types of nationalism:" + "\n" + "-Liberal: combined w/ideas of the French Revolution, the liberal nationalists stated that no country is better than another, but that each country has its own unique qualities. All nations deserve to be unified and led by people of their own nationality who can provide the nation with a constitution that is rational, reasonable and just, they said." + "\n" + "-Militaristic: associated w/ideas of social Darwinism and Realpolitik, the claim of militaristic nationalism is that one’s nation is better, not just different. Machiavellian politicians who are out for personal power can exploit this form of nationalism. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VIII. The Crimean War:" + "\n" + "• Nationalist tensions led to the Crimean War, which originated over competing claims by Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox monks to be the guardians of Jerusalem’s holy places. " + "\n" + "• France pressured the Ottoman sultan into giving the Catholics special privileges, which caused the Russians to demand a protectorate over Orthodox churches w/in the Ottoman Empire. " + "\n" + "-Then the Russians occupied Wallachia and Moldavia, Danubian lands that were under the Ottomans." + "\n" + "• English urged the sultan to resist the Russian demands.

But, they couldn’t find a king, and finally had to settle for an Italian prince who gave up after three years. " + "\n" + "-The republic only lasted two more years until Isabella’s son was reinstalled as Alfonso XII. " + "\n" + "-Little change occurred during his reign, and a parliamentary system based on limited suffrage did little to reform the country. " + "\n" + "- Industrialization made everything worse, and, in Cuba, the gov’t was soon faced w/guerilla war and was forced to withdraw. This led to more thought, but not enough, for in 1909 the tensions resulted in a week of violence in Barcelona. This was put down, and the moderate regime came back. " + "\n" + "VII. England’s Domestic Policies:" + "\n" + "-In England, the domestic issues were resolved through a two-party system. William Gladstone transformed the Whigs into the Liberal Party, and Benjamin Disraeli turned the Tories into the Conservative Party. " + "\n" + "-Gladstone supported increased suffrage and reform, and even sympathized with radicals. Disraeli supported a simper suffrage reform bill, which was passed in 1867. " + "\n" + "-The larger electorate provided for in 1867 allowed the Liberals to dominate for six years. The Liberals reformed education, the army, disestablished the Anglican Church of Ireland and restricted the abuses of absentee landlords. When the Conservatives returned in 1874, they expanded the authority of the state and added social welfare bills. " + "\n" + "- While the Conservatives promoted British power abroad, they restructured local government by making country councils elective and therefore more democratic (1888, 1894) and extended the reforms of the civil service " + "\n" + "- But the working class was still dissatisfied, and, in 1900, union representative and intellectuals combined to for the Labour party, which was basically a democratic socialist party. The Liberal and the Labour parties campaigned for social programs that the Conservatives were against. " + "\n" + "- In 1906, the Liberals won again, and they established programs of workers’ compensation, old-age pensions and urban planning. " + "\n" + "-This led David Lloyd George to propose the “people’s budget” in 1909, which was rejected by the House of Lords. " + "\n" + "-But the king, who threatened to appointed more peers, forced the upper house to consent to the budget and a change in the constitution, which prohibited the Lords from vetoing money bills or anything that passed three times." + "\n" + "- The conflict led to an increase in social tension: there were more strikes and violence, and there was a possibility of the dreaded general strike. And, when in 1914 the Commons gave the Irish home rule, the Protestants of N. Ireland threatened civil war."

            twenText.text = "I. Influences on Twentieth Century Culture:" + "\n" + "• In the twentieth century, small movements in new directions from prior decades became dominant in many fields. Psychology, literature and art probed the irrational and surreal." + "\n" + "• Sigmund Freud’s discoveries had huge influence and implications. " + "\n" + "-Freud stated that the mind was divided into the unconscious, the subconscious, and the conscious, and that people were driven by the id (instinctual urges residing in the unconscious), which is controlled by the ego, which is told to do so by the superego (conscience imposed by society). " + "\n" + "-He also found that all memories were kept, in some from, and that repression of memories from the conscious mind led to neuroses. " + "\n" + "• From Freud’s discoveries, many inferred that greater candor in society would lead to a happier population " + "\n"
                + "• Carl G. Jung broke from Freud and developed a theory of the collective unconscious (a common bond between who peoples expressed in rituals)." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. Movements in Literature:" + "\n" + "• Surrealism: the surrealists applied Freudian ideas directly and believed art had to penetrate the subconscious. Both an artistic and literary movement, surrealism explored inner thoughts and dreams." + "\n" + "• Other writers, though not necessarily surrealists, explored human irrationality. " + "\n" + "-For example: Marcel Proust (who wrote Remembrance of Things Past and focused on interior monologue and the expression of the narrator’s feelings), -" + "\n" + "-Franz Kafka (who wrote descriptions of twisted fantasies), James Joyce (who wrote Ulysses, which told a day in the life of the average Dubliner on epic proportions) and Virginia Woolf (who was a political activist and feminist w/A Room of One’s Own)." + "\n" + "• In general, novelists turned away from the clear, chronological narratives of the past and focused more on controversial issues and the exploration of dreams and fantasies. " + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Movements in Art:" + "\n"
                + "• In all the arts, the new thing was to shock the audience by presenting absurd things, etc. The Dadaists were excellent and this, and used their bizarre routines to infuriate the proper Paris bourgeoisie. The Futurists in Italy were obsessed with speed, and the Fauvres in France and the Expressionists in Germany aimed to wildly break conventions. " + "\n" + "• In painting, the Cubists and Expressionists confused people with their strange designs, often incorporating violence and amorality. " + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. Movements in Philosophy:" + "\n" + "• The big philosophical work of this time was by Oswald Spengler and was called the Decline of the West. " + "\n" + "-He treated civilizations as living organisms and stated that WWI was the beginning of the end for Western Civilization. " + "\n" + "-Jose Ortega y Gasset was just as pessimistic in The Revolt of the Masses, for he stated that the masses would use their rising power to destroy civilization’s achievements. " + "\n" + "• In Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead stated that philosophers should only worry about things that were precise and empirically demonstrable. "
                + "\n" + "\n" + "V. Advances in Science: " + "\n" + "• By this time, science had become incomprehensible to the average person. It became increasingly specialized, and even though people generally knew the implications of the theories" + "\n" + "• Albert Michelson and Edward Morley in 1887 started one line of new thinking by challenging the theory that the universe was filled w/a substance called ether. Albert Einstein followed up on this in his Theory of Relativity, which stated that space and time were not absolute. " + "\n" + "• Physicists were also finding a new understanding of matter. In 1895, Willhelm Roentgen discovered x-rays, and two years later J.J. Thomson proved that the electron existed. Researchers like Pierre and Marie Curie explored radioactivity and further proved the divisibility of the atom. " + "\n" + "• This led to quantum physics, or the attempt to explain why Newton’s laws didn’t work for subatomic particles. "
                + "\n" + "-Max Planck challenged Newton in 1902 by showing energy was emitted in quanta and had many properties of matter" + "\n" + "• Werner Heisenberg then came up with the Uncertainty Principle, which stated they really couldn’t know anything for sure. " + "\n" + "- In biology, advances were made in the study of heredity and in the isolation of viruses (which led to new drugs like penicillin). In sociology, the big guys were Emile Durkheim and Max Weber (the “ideal type”). They both were concerned w/the customs that held society together and were concerned about what happened when group norms broke down. " + "\n" + "\n" + "VI. Popular Culture:" + "\n" + "• There were many new technologies and lots of excitement in the 1920s. New and daring styles of architecture became popular, as did advertising." + "\n" + "• Movies took full advantage of the trend towards distortion sin time and perspective. " + "\n" + "• They also became super popular as well as very profitable. All sorts of people, from the rich to the poor, attended the movies, although movies became more specialized to each country with the introduction of sound in 1929. "

But, because only the upper classes were allowed to vote, the conservatives pretty much dominated the Duma and blocked reforms. " + "\n" + "• When the war broke out in 1914, the Duma was suspended and Tsar Nicholas II went to command the army. He left his wife to run the country. " + "\n" + "• Throughout 1916, discontent mounted to an almost intolerable level. Transportation was poor, production low, war refugees were everywhere, there were terrible food shortages " + "\n" + "• So, in March 1917 (called either the March Revolution or the February Revolution), strikers filled the streets of Petrograd and, led by the Soviet of Workers they joined with the Duma committee and formed a provisional government. Nicholas II, who couldn’t count on the army’s support, was forced to abdicate. " + "\n" + "• The provisional government was mainly moderate bourgeoisie (it was led by Milyukov and the only socialist was Kerensky, who was a social revolutionary and part of the Petrograd soviet) and it quickly established civil liberties, gave political prisoners amnesty, and stopped religious persecution. But, besides supporting the 8-hour-workday and ordering the abolition of class privileges, it left the other social issues to the constituent assembly it promised to call soon. " + "\n" + "• The revolutionaries were actually highly divided, for Russia had many revolutionary parties, such as:" + "\n" + "-Cadets: short for constitutional democrats, they were the most moderate of the revolutionaries and aimed for a liberal democracy" + "\n" + "-Social Revolutionaries: the SRs were mainly concerned with the peasants" + "\n" + "-Social Democrats: were the Marxists, but they were also divided between the Bolsheviks (Lenin’s group) and the Mensheviks." + "\n" + "• The Bolsheviks (led by Lenin) wanted a hard-core, ultra-organized revolutionary group to be the vanguard of the revolution and they did not want to cooperate w/the Cadets. The Mensheviks wanted a larger party of part time revolutionaries and wanted to cooperate w/the Cadets." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. The November Revolution:" + "\n" + "• While the first revolution occurred in Russia, Lenin, in exile in Switzerland, was organizing his party and formulating a new version of Marxism. Lenin stated that there was not going to be a spontaneous awakening of class and that an energetic party of revolutionaries was needed to divert the proletariat and take them towards the real revolution." + "\n" + "-In April 1917, however, the let Lenin back into Russia though a closed railroad car. He issued the April Theses (a masterpiece of propaganda), which supported “Peace, Land, and Bread” and All Power to the Soviets" + "\n" + "• The provisional government was collapsing. There were disagreements over war policy and strikes. Kerensky became the leader, but his gov’t was attacked from left and right (the Kornilov Coup)." + "\n" + "-Kerensky still focused on the war, and in his attempt to get just one more great offensive (it never worked) he lost much public support." + "\n" + "• Because of the Kornilov Coup, Kerensky asked the left to help defend the gov’t, so all the Bolsheviks were let out of prison. They won control of the Moscow and Petrograd soviets, and Trotsky was elected president of the Petrograd soviet." + "\n" + "• On November 6th, Lenin seized power in Petrograd and Moscow, and announced to the Congress that the Bolsheviks held power and were taking control of the armies. Although Kerensky tried to gain support, the armies were not interested in fighting for him." + "\n" + "• Congress approved a one-party cabinet: the Congress of Soviets replaced the parliament; they elected a Central Executive committee, which advised the cabinet. There was no real elected body – though elections were held for the constituent assembly it was dismissed after one day." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Communist Russia:" + "\n" + "• First, the Communists declared that land, livestock, and farm equipment belonged to the state but could be temporarily held by peasants. They also stated that no peasant was to work for hire, and that committees of the poor would supervise the allocation of land." + "\n" + "• In the next few months, everything was nationalized: railroads, banks, foreign trade, etc. A new secret police, the Cheka was established as well." + "\n" + "• Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: in February 1918 Russia just stopped fighting, and in March Russia surrendered to the harsh Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which forced Russia to surrender more than one million square miles of territory to Germany." + "\n" + "-The communists tolerated the harsh terms because they felt that a revolution would soon occur in Germany as well." + "\n" + "• In July, Russia was declared a federation and political power was given to the local soviets, organized by occupation and elected by universal suffrage." + "\n" + "-The soviets elected delegates, who elected more delegates, up until the all-Russia Congress." + "\n" + "-The Communist party was not mentioned, but it really ran the show, for its Central Committee elected the Politburo, which shared power with the Council of People’s Commissars (but in reality it was all the Politburo)." + "\n" + "• Red/White Civil War: then, from 1918 to 1921, brutal civil war of Communists vs. Everyone Else." + "\n" + "-troops weren’t committed to fighting the Bolsheviks, the Red Army won out, but at enormous cost (the policy of War Communism, which was stealing food from the peasants to feed the cities, caused agriculture to drop to 1/5th of its former level). After the civil war, there was the Communist-run Red Terror." + "\n" + "• Then, rising discontent caused Lenin to introduce the NEP (New Economic Policy), which is Bukharin’s pet project. The NEP is basically a retreat back to capitalism" + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. Stalin’s Rise to Power:" + "\n" + "The candidates are:" + "\n" + "1. Leon Trotsky: commander in chief of the army, and secretary of state." + "\n" + "2. Gregory Zinoviev: leader of the Comintern (spreading the Rev to other countries)." + "\n" + "3. Les Kamenev: chief of staff." + "\n" + "4. Nikolai Bukharin: chief of propaganda (a little more conservative, NEP)." + "\n" + "5. Joseph Stalin: considered by far the least talented, not a great thinker or speaker, did nothing during the Revolution or Civil War; he is made the Secretary of the Party." + "\n" + "- They see the parallels to the FR, and they are all wondering who Napoleon will be. Everyone thinks it will be Trotsky who they dislike as he joined the party late and is not trusted." + "\n" + "- So Stalin, Kamenev and Zinoviev form a STOP TROTSKY movement. They also form a Lenin Cult (a Cult of Personality), which turns Lenin into a God of Communism. Trotsky hates this, since he knows Lenin wasn’t infallible. But Stalin and co. use the Lenin Cult to prove all the times that Trotsky was supposedly wrong (whenever he disagreed with Lenin)." + "\n" + "- On his deathbed, Lenin realizes what Stalin is doing and writes in his will that Stalin should be expelled. But when they open the will, Kamenev and Zinoviev leap to Stalin’s defense and say that this one time Lenin made a mistake, and vote to suppress the will and win." + "\n" + "• Meanwhile, several ideological debates continue:" + "\n" + "1. NEP vs. Collectivization: while Bukharin wants to keep the NEP permanently, Trotsky wants to start collectivization (instead of small private farms, big state run farms). Stalin sides with Bukharin as a pretext to attack Trotsky." + "\n" + "2. Permanent Revolution vs. Socialism in One Country: since Trotsky wants to spread the Revolution throughout Europe, Stalin states he wants to focus on Russia." + "\n" + "• By 1925, Trotsky is forced to step down from the army and is exiled by 1927." + "\n" + "\n" + "V. Russia Under Stalin:" + "\n" + "• A new term, totalitarianism, was invented to describe Stalin’s control over Russia (and Hitler’s over Germany, etc)" + "\n" + "• After eliminating Trotsky Stalin moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev. He kicked them out of the party and replaced them with loyal supporters." + "\n" + "• In 1927, Stalin attacks Bukharin and proposes collectivization (as his own idea, of course). Bukharin (finally) gets the idea." + "\n" + "-Then in 1928, Stalin proclaims that he is “the Lenin of today” and turns himself into a living God of Communism." + "\n" + "- Collectivization: a.k.a. the First Five Year Plan (1928 to 1932). Peasants were forced off their land or whole villages were destroyed. Then, they were forced onto state run farms. Although it was absolutely brutal, it worked! Industry grew tremendously. Still, agriculture declined." + "\n" + "• Then, Stalin began a series of purges after the assassination of Serge Kirov (a popular Stalinist who was actually killed on Stalin’s orders as a pretext and also b/c he was becoming too popular)." + "\n" + "• He used the NKVD – in a series of show trials he had all the old Bolsheviks (anyone who was around at the Revolution) “confess” to crimes against the state – Bukharin, Zinoviev, all the army officers, etc."

            riseText.text = "I. The Definition of Fascism:" + "\n" + "• The twentieth century gave rise to several new forms of government. While in Russia, people turned to Communism during and following World War I, in Italy and Germany, people turned to another form of government known as Fascism." + "\n" + "• Like the Communists, the Fascists were a misery party. Although the Communists and Fascists were sworn enemies, they were actually pretty similar. Or at least that is how it turned out when looking at the Soviet regime." + "\n" + "• Fascists had no exact ideology (there was no Fascist Karl Marx to write it out) and, unlike Communism, it was not an intellectual movement." + "\n" + "-The Fascists just ripped off the ideas of other people, like Nietzsche or Sorel’s Reflections of Violence and used them for their own purposes." + "\n" + "• The Fascists tended to glorify violence, think of the welfare of the state, and ignore the rights of the individual. Fascists stressed nationalism and militarism, and the end goal of their regimes was to have a dictatorship that embodied the spirit of “the people”. Fervent love for the state and not thinking was encouraged in Fascist regimes as well." + "\n" + "\n" + "II. The Rise of Fascism in Italy:" + "\n" + "• After WWI, Italy was definitely looking for a misery party: unemployment rates were high, there was a lot of inflation, and there was talk of revolution. Peasants were stealing land, and striking workers and angry industrialists were struggling for control. The upper classes feared a Communist rebellion, social issues had not been addressed, and the peace treaty had made people mad." + "\n" + "• During this time the first Fascist movement was born. Led by Benito Mussolini, the Fascists denounced liberalism using leftist rhetoric and denounced Marxism b/c of its lack of nationalistic sentiment. They effectively used propaganda and activists to spread their message." + "\n" + "• At first the Fascists were not very successful. In 1921, during the first elections with universal male suffrage, two new parties rose to power. The Fascists won 35 seats, and were included in the prime minister Giolitti’s personal coalition." + "\n" + "• But instead of just operating by the rules, the Fascists used their black shirted activists to plant bombs, beat up other parties, disrupt meetings, and scare people." + "\n" + "- Then, when the left wing unions called a general strike in 1922, the Black Shirts started to take over town councils by force. In October, they staged a march on Rome. Parliamentary leaders woke up after a while, called for martial law, but the King (Victor Emmanuel III) refused. Mussolini reached Rome, where he was invited to form a cabinet by the King." + "\n" + "- So Mussolini became the prime minister, and his party won a huge victory in the elections of 1924 b/c of his techniques of intimidation and fraud. Then he began terrorizing the opposition and shooting their leaders. The opposition was unable to respond effectively b/c they were so divided." + "\n" + "\n" + "III. Italy Under Mussolini:" + "\n" + "• By 1925 Mussolini had gotten rid of all his opponents and gained control of the press. He then moved to make his power official by passing a series of law that declared the Duce of Fascism the head of state w/the right to govern by decree. Opposition parties were outlawed, opponents arrested and the civil services and judiciary branches were purged of any people thought too independent." + "\n" + "• During this time, Mussolini’s immense propaganda machine created a Cult of Personality. Italians were told to obey the leader and to fight for their country, and were filled with nationalistic pride and confidence. The single-party government reached into every aspect of Italian life." + "\n" + "-Armed with a militant secret police, the Fascist party kept tight control on the country and soon won thousands of new supporters." + "\n" + "• The Fascists didn’t really have a consistent ideology or policy, but they did establish the Corporate State in Italy. In the Corporate State, each sector of production was supposed to be organized into a huge corporation." + "\n" + "• Each corporation was headed by a party member appointed by the government, and was to establish the policies for the industry and wage scales." + "\n" + "• By 1926, they were able to outlaw strikes and unions b/c of the corporate system. They fixed the number of corporations at 22, and the Duce was made president of each of them. He also appointed the Council of Delegates for each corporation." + "\n" + "-Consequently, the corporations never achieved any real autonomy and had no power." + "\n" + "• Italy never became as orderly as Mussolini promised, but freedom and individual rights were destroyed. Although a quiet intellectual opposition was allowed, thousands of people were exiled or killed for opposing the government." + "\n" + "• In economics, the Fascists sought autarchy and were into industrialization and technology. The government didn’t mind big business but generally favored nationalization. In 1926, they began a big campaign to increase agricultural production, which led to a doubling in grain production." + "\n" + "• The government attempted to keep peasants on the land and increase the birthrate, but neither campaign was effective. They were, however, able to stop the Mafia in Sicily, drain the marshes near Rome, and build railroads and superhighways. They used these public works programs to combat unemployment, and this gave people a sense of security." + "\n" + "- Mussolini’s biggest achievement was his agreement with the Vatican, known as the Lateran Agreement (1929). In the agreement, Mussolini recognized Vatican City as an independent state, established religious teaching in public schools, guaranteed that marriage laws would conform to Catholic doctrine, promised to restrict the Protestants and promised to give the Church money to pay for the damage done during Italian unification." + "\n" + "\n" + "IV. Germany after World War I:" + "\n" + "• After World War I, Germany had a democracy known as the Weimar Republic. It was headed by a President who oversaw the country but didn’t make day-to-day decisions." + "\n" + "• The President could call new elections at any time. The Chancellor (elected from the majority party in the Reichstag) ran the country." + "\n" + "-The Reichstag (Parliament) was formed through direct elections where people voted for a party (not for people) and the % of votes a party received was the % of the seats the party got." + "\n" + "• Since the Chancellor came from the majority party, if there was no majority party, the President was allowed to appoint a Chancellor. There were three types of Chancellor:" + "\n" + "1. Parliamentary Chancellor: the Parliamentary Chancellor could suggest laws, but the laws had to be passed by a majority vote of the Reichstag." + "\n" + "2. Presidential Chancellor: the Presidential Chancellor could declare laws by decree unless a majority of the Reichstag vetoed them. To stop a Presidential Chancellor, there would have to be a “negative majority” in the Reichstag." + "\n" + "3. Temporary Dictator: the Constitution also allowed for a “temporary dictator” in times of emergency if 2/3 of the Reichstag agreed." + "\n" + "• At first, the Weimar Republic had a really rough time. The Republic’s first act on November 11, 1918 was to agree to an armistice." + "\n" + "• After a war that had totally exhausted the country, it was really hard for Germany to bear defeat. The army consequently made up a myth about being “stabbed in the back” by people inside Germany. According to them, it was the left-wing politicians (also Jewish people) that caused their loss." + "\n" + "• During this time President Hindenburg and Chancellor Ebert ran the country. The democracy seemed on the right track, even though the SPD (Socialists) had made a horrid deal with the army, which led to the brutal murder of the Spartakus Band (ancestors of the KPD: Communists). After this, the KPD had no leaders (and was controlled by Moscow) and the left was forever divided." + "\n" + "• In 1920, there was the Kapp Putsch, in which the right-wing extremist army officers seized Berlin. Although the army would not fire on them, they were eventually forced to withdraw by the left-wing labor unions. This contributed to the instability of the time." + "\n" + "-Then in 1923 came horrible ultra-inflation! Caused by the French occupation of the Ruhr b/c when Germany fell behind in paying the reparations that French seized the German factories, the German workers went on strike, and then, when the gov’t decided to pay the French, money became worthless." + "\n" + "-This was horrible for people: all their savings disappeared – and was seen as the second failure of the Weimar Republic" + "\n" + "-Then on November 8/9, 1923, the Beer Hall Putsch occurs, led by General Ludendorff and Hitler (unknown at the time). It fails miserably, but Hitler gets nat’l press coverage, gets out of jail after a really short time, and learns that legality is the way to go" + "\n" + "-From 1925 to 1925, Germany gets admitted into the League of Nations and is back in the international community. Moderate parties are doing well, not the Nazis." + "\n" + "• But then in 1929 w/the Great Depression everything collapses. Since Germany is dependent on US $, when the US economy crashes so does the German, only worse. Now the “misery parties” begin to come into their own" + "\n" + "\n" + "V. The Rise of Fascism in Germany:" + "\n" + "• One party that made a spectacular rise with the onset of the depression was the Nazi party, led by Adolph Hitler" + "\n" + "• The Nazis attacked democracy, advocated war against Germany’s enemies (Jews, Communists, other nations, etc.) and had the SA (a street army of brown-shirted storm troopers), the SS (an elite group in black uniforms who were bodyguards and special police), and propaganda to spread their message." + "\n" + "• With the depression and the failure of the Republic to solve the problems plaguing it the Nazis, with their calls for rearmament and stopping the Communists, became more popular." + "\n" + "- Because of the depression, in 1930 the coalition government of Social Democrats resigned and the Center party took over. Hindenburg allowed the new government to enact measures by decree, but this didn’t help b/c there was a negative majority so nothing could get done." + "\n" + "- Since the 1930 election gave the Nazis more seats Hitler ran for president in 1932 (though he knew he would lose against Hindenburg). He lost, but he got lots of press coverage, etc. Hindenburg then picked a new chancellor Franz von Papen" + "\n" + "• Papen tried to gain Hitler’s support by lifting the bans on the SA and SS and tried to form a right-wing coalition. But it didn’t work, Hindenburg called another election, and the Nazis gained! But Hindenburg (who didn’t like Hitler) still didn’t name him chancellor, picking Von Schleicher." + "\n" + "• Now Papen (who wanted to get back into power) told Hindenburg to appoint Hitler the head of a coalition government (the only way to stop the negative majority). He did so on the terms that: there would be no other Nazis in the cabinet, and every time Hitler met w/him Papen would be there too." + "\n" + "• Papen thought he could use Hitler, but the joke was on him – it was the other way around. Again being underestimated is a big advantage (think Napoleon). Hitler takes the deal in 1933. Almost immediately, he called another election, and through cheating, the Nazis won an even bigger majority." + "\n" + "- Then the Reichstag building was set on fire.

In 1935, the gov’t codified its anti-Semitic beliefs in the Nuremberg Laws and then added many other horrible laws to oppress the Jewish people." + "\n" + "• In 1938 Kristallnacht occurred after a Jewish boy murdered a German diplomat: Jews were beaten and murdered and their property was destroyed.

On March 9 (Saturday Night Special) Hitler announces he will build an air force. There are no protests. On March 16 (SNS) he announces that Germany will build a navy and a ½ million man army.

In it the Loyalists/Republicans (liberals, socialists, communists, etc.) fight the fascists (army and Franco).

Finland wasn’t too hot on the idea, Stalin wanted to rush in and kick their butts, but it proved to be harder than expected as the Finns held the Russians back for weeks. Finally the Russians won Hitler (and Stalin who then reorganized the army) realized the Russian army was in bad shape." + "\n"

Luckily, the British won out using their radar technology and the Germans turned their sights to Russia" + "\n" + "• Hitler’s attack on Russia totally surprised Stalin, and the Germans were kicking the Red Army’s butt. Millions of Russian troops were killed or captured" + "\n" + "• But they still couldn’t capture Moscow or Leningrad. Then on December 6, the Russians suddenly counterattacked the Germans at Moscow" + "\n" + "• Then on December 7, Pearl Harbor. The US declares war on Japan, and then Germany declares war on the US" + "\n" + "• The German army was barely surviving the Russian winter. Their plan was to capture the oil fields in the southern USSR. The crucial battle to get there was the battle of Stalingrad" + "\n" + "- In November 1942, the Red Army was able to surround the Germans at Stalingrad and they are cut off. Hitler does not allow his troops to retreat, but by January 1943 remaining troops surrender." + "\n" + "- Things go from bad to worse for the Germans and Germany surrenders unconditionally on May 8, 1945 (VE Day). Hitler had killed himself (4/30/45) to avoid being captured by the Russians." + "\n" + "- The other WWII fronts included:" + "\n" + "1. North Atlantic: Allies were battling U-boats to ensure that they would be able to attack Europe from Britain." + "\n" + "2. North Africa: British and Americans against Rommel’s Afrika Korps, Axis driven out in 1942. Then Americans were told to go after Italy, which was stupid." + "\n" + "3. Italy: Americans land there and take over Sicily, so the Italians get rid of Mussolini and surrender. But then Germany took over Italy and continued the war there to great effect as they kept lots of Allied troops busy and accomplishing nothing."

Led by Eisenhower, the allies caught the Germans by surprise and moved across northern France.

The Aftermath of the War:" + "\n" + "- After the war, all of Europe was in shambles. Major cities had been destroyed as a result of bombing, industry was really messed up, there were refugees everywhere, etc." + "\n" + "- There was no big peace conference after WWII, but along the course of the war several meetings of the allies had helped decide policy:1.

This meeting was important for it is often considered the beginning of the cold war. At Yalta, it was decided to divide Germany into 4 zones (US, USSR, British, French) and Berlin into zones as well. The Allies decided to occupy and demilitarize Germany. Since US didn’t have bomb yet it was thought Japan war would go on for several years, so the US wanted USSR support and got it in exchange for Russia getting the land it lost in the Russo-Japanese war. It was agreed Eastern Europe would have free elections but the governments would have to be “friendly” to the USSR." + "\n" + "4. Potsdam: After the war was over, in July 1945, the Allies met and outlined the future of Germany. The borders in Eastern Europe were changed a little and the zones of occupation in Germany were established. They also worked out terms of peace w/ Japan." + "\n" + "• Then there were a series of trial, the Nuremberg Trials, which tried the Nazi war criminals in 1945 and 1946. Several international agencies, including the United Nations, were created after WWII. Mainly, after WWII, there was an era of slow (but steady) recovery helped by the US. Of course, there was also the threat of the Cold War."
